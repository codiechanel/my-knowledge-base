## Monorepos

Instead of relying on binaries, monorepos directly to the source code of the modules it depends on.

One advantage of a monorepo is the sharing of common 3rd party libraries. For instance, module A and module B both rely on  third party library X. Then, they only have to install the library once. All libraries in a monorepo is installed on the root folder.
