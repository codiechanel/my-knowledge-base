As of March 2017, most browsers shipped native, unprefixed support for CSS Grid: Chrome \(including on Android\), Firefox, Safari \(including on iOS\), and Opera. Internet Explorer 10 and 11 on the other hand support it, but it's an old implementation with an outdated syntax. The time to build with grid is now!
